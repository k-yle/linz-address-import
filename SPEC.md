# osmPatchFile format

This tool generates `osmPatchFile`s, which are geojson files that [our fork of RapiD](https://github.com/osm-nz/RapiD) uses to `add`, `edit`, `move`, or `delete` OSM feaures.

Other tools can generate files in the same format. Users can add their own osmPatchFile files in the editor.

# Tags

The `properties` of a geojson item must contain `__action`, unless you are creating a new feature. All other `properties` are OSM tags.

However, the tags are a **diff**. This means:

1. Any tags specified in the patch file will override the tag if it exists on the OSM feature, or add the tag if it doesn't exist.
2. Any tags that exist on the OSM feature, but not in `properties` will be retained.
3. To remove a tag, set the value to `üóëÔ∏è`
