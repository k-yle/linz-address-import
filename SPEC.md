# osmPatchFile format

This tool generates `osmPatchFile`s, which are geojson files that [our fork of RapiD](https://github.com/osm-nz/RapiD) uses to `add`, `edit`, `move`, or `delete` OSM feaures.

Other tools can generate files in the same format. Users can add their own osmPatchFile files in the editor.

# Tags

The `properties` of a geojson item must contain `__osmId`, unless you are creating a new feature. All other `properties` are OSM tags.

However, the tags are a **diff**. This means:

1. Any specified tags will override the tag if it exists, or add the tag if it doesn't exist
2. Any tags that exist on the OSM feature, but not in `properties` will be retained
3. To remove a tag, set the value to `üóëÔ∏è`
